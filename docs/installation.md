# Custom Models Installation

If you want to use custom models for your cameras or drones, download the [custom_models.txt](https://github.com/Keplyx/cameras-and-drones/blob/master/gamedata/cameras-and-drones/custom_models.txt) file and place it in your server inside "csgo/addons/sourcemod/gamedata/cameras-and-drones/".

# TTT Integration

This plugin is compatible with [Trouble in Terrorist Town](https://github.com/Bara/TroubleinTerroristTown) for csgo by [Bara](https://github.com/Bara).

Just install TTT and cameras and drones normaly for it to work.
You will want to set the cvars `cd_droneprice "30000"` and `cd_camprice "30000"` to prevent players from buying gear outside of the traitor menu.
