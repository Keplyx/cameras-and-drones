# Installation


## Plugin Installation
Simply download **[cameras-and-drones.smx](https://github.com/Keplyx/cameras-and-drones/raw/master/plugins/cameras-and-drones.smx)** and place it in your server inside "csgo/addons/sourcemod/plugins/".
A map is currently being made to work along with this plugin. [Get it here!](http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1102250426)

## Custom Models Installation
If you want to use custom models for your cameras or drones, download the [custom_models.txt](https://github.com/Keplyx/cameras-and-drones/blob/master/gamedata/cameras-and-drones/custom_models.txt) file and place it in your server inside "csgo/addons/sourcemod/gamedata/cameras-and-drones/".

## Compatibility
### TTT
This plugin is compatible with [Trouble in Terrorist Town](https://github.com/Bara/TroubleinTerroristTown) for csgo by [Bara](https://github.com/Bara).

Just install TTT and cameras and drones normally for it to work.
You will want to set the cvars *cd_droneprice "30000"* and *cd_camprice "30000"* to prevent players from buying gear outside of the traitor menu.

### Tactical Tactical
This plugin is compatible with [Tactical Shield](https://keplyx.github.io/TacticalShield/index.html).

You can use both plugins without any problem!
If you find a bug, please post an issue on github.
